    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
      <p id="characters">Simba is a rowdy, independent little cub who likes to romp and play. When Simba's father dies,
        it leaves Simba unsure about who he is. Then Rafiki shows Simba his reflection in a pool and the young lion
        understands that his father's courage and wisdom are a part of him, too. — © 1994 Skybox</p>

  <h2>Nala</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
      <p id="characters">Every bit as rambunctious as Simba, Nala is ready to go wherever he goes or do whatever he
        does. Best buddies, the twosome are taken aback when Zazu tells them they are to be married. What a yucky idea!
        But time changes things, and when they meet again, they realize their friendship has deepened into love. — ©

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
      <p id="characters">Regal, commanding and majestic, Mufasa is a great king with a kind, generous heart. Concerned
        with teaching his son Simba to be a wise, responsible adult and king, Mufasa can seem a bit stern at times, but
        it's only because he loves Simba and wants to keep the youngster on the right track. — © 1994 Skybox</p>

  <h2>Scar</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
      <p id="characters">As Mufasa's brother, Scar was next in line for the throne until Simba's birth, and he is
        obsessed with the need to possess it. Although Scar hides his plot with concern for Simba's safety, this evil,
        cunning betrayer is really Simba's and Mufasa's enemy-- a fact which the great-hearted Mufasa realizes too late.

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
          <p id="characters"> Rafiki, the wise old baboon, is like a tribal medicine man or an ancient shaman. Rafiki
            travels his own road, sings his own songs and knows what he knows. After anointing newborn Simba, Rafiki
            wanders off on his mystical way. He returns again to guide Simba back to the path he was meant to follow. —

      <h2>Zazu</h2>
      <div class="row">
       
        <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
          <p id="characters">Mufasa's trusted advisor, Zazu is a prim and proper hornbill with a strong sense of
            personal dignity. Although Zazu's feathers can be easily ruffled, he is dedicated to Mufasa. The honorable
            hornbill would give his right wing for the lion king and stays with the pride through good and bad times. —

        <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
          <p id="characters">Timon is a hyperactive meerkat with a motor mouth. Whether he's making good-natured jokes
            at Pumbaa's expense or pitching his free-wheeling lifestyle to Simba, Timon always has a fast line. But
            behind the patter is a loyal little guy who'd give his last wisecrack to help a friend. — © 1994 Skybox</p>

      <h2>Pumbaa</h2>
      <div class="row">

        

      <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
        <p id="characters">A well-padded warthog, Pumbaa is a bit clumsy and dimwitted, but his empathy and intuition
          make up for his slow thought processes. Sympathetic and warm-hearted, Pumbaa is ready to trust anyone-- even a
          carnivore like Simba. And when Simba confronts his destiny, the loyal warthog is the first to follow. — © 1994

      <div class="col-sm 2 col-lg-6">
        <p id="characters">Always on the lookout for their next meal or an innocent victim to taunt, tease or terrorize,
          Banzai, the male hyena, and Shenzi, the female, talk and joke while Ed, the third troublemaker, only laughs.
          When they're not arguing, these three punks can be found doing Scar's dirty work-- which is no laughing
          matter.

    <h2>Sarabi</h2>

    <div class="row">
      
      <div class="col-sm-2 col-lg-5">
        <p id="characters">Sarabi, Mufasa's wife and Simba's mother, is kind, gentle and loving. She's also wise to her
          little son's tricks. Courageous Sarabi holds her own through Scar's destructive rule, and is proud when her
          son
          comes back to battle the evil ruler and claim his rightful place as King.— © 1994 Skybox</p>
